# PerceptiLabs Community Model

This GAN framework was built using PerceptiLabs and following allong with their tutorial series on building a machine learning model from scratch.

* Using the PerceptiLabs platform I built a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) machine learning model. 
* In this model the generator took randomly generated numbers to test against the discriminator. 
* The data originated from a dataset provided by PerceptiLabs (gan_mnist.py)

# Model Structure

Describe the directory/file structure of your model here. For example, you could describe the structure as shown here:

* **/Data**: contains pre-processed versions of the data. This data is split into two sub directories:
  * **/Data/short_cropped**: contains the raw cropped data in .png format.
  * **/Data/long_cropped**: contains preprocessed cropped data in .png format.
* **/Model**: contains the PerceptiLabs model file (model.json).
