# PerceptiLabs Community Model

This GAN framework was built using PerceptiLabs and following allong with their tutorial series on building a machine learning model from scratch.

* Using the PerceptiLabs platform I built a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) machine learning model. 
* In this model the generator took randomly generated numbers to test against the discriminator. 
* The data originated from a dataset provided by PerceptiLabs.

# Model Structure

* **/gan_mnist**: contains the data file
* **/checkkpointt**: contains the checkpoint model, index, and data checkpoints.
* **/Model**: contains the PerceptiLabs model file (model.json).
* **/Model**: contains the Jupyter Notebook that contains the model code (GANmodel.ipynb).
